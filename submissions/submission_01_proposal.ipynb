This could help us to estimate, for example, if some states are more prone to religious violence during months of Ramadan. However, due to insufficient data in the dataset, we are only focusing on the correlation between states and the time of year."

The fundamental question we ask when assessing datasets such as these is the change over time. Whether the number of hate crimes has increased and whether there's a significant change in one motivation as opposed to others. Additionally, for this task, we will be combining the two motivations, race and ethnicity, for the year 2013 to have \"symmetrical\" data. This can also somewhat reflect on another political question: whether there were higher hate crimes under the Obama administration or under Trump. However, since FBI does not have statistics on this after 2019 (at least not publicly), we cannot, for example, ascertain how COVID-19 affected hate crimes. \n"
